# Functions

Functions are groupings of code that complete a task (function). These functions can be called upon anywhere within the code. Creating a function prevents having to replicate the same code over and over.

## LinuxGSM Functions

All functions within LinuxGSM begin with the prefix `fn_` and should be descriptive of what the function is doing. Words are separated by an underscore `_`.

For LinuxGSM development, it is important that developers understand what a function does which is why all function names must describe the purpose of the function. A longer function name that describes the function is preferred over a short one that does not.

### Examples

```
fn_stop_graceful_cmd
```

```
fn_update_ts3_dl
```

### Syntax

All functions should be formatted with the following syntax.

```
fn_function_name(){
    code
}
```
