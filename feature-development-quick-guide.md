# Feature Development Quick Guide

## Intro

This guide will give a brief oveview on how to get started developing LinuxGSM.

## Requirements

Before you get started a few tools are required for development. The tools used are down to the developers preferences. However there are some reccomendations if you are new.

### Text editor

LinuxGSM is written in BASH and can be developed simply by using a text editor. The reccomended text editor is Atom as it is Open Source and is developed by GitHub so has some great integrations. However if a developer is more comfortable with another editor that is fine.  For specific requirements for text editors see [Text Editor Settings](text-editor-settings.md).

* Atom \(recommended\)
* Sublime Text
* Notepad++

### Git Client

To edit code, create branches and submit Pull Requests a Git client is required to work on the project. The reccomended Git client is Git Kracken as it is feature rich and easy to understand the branch relationships.  Atom also has a built in Git Client which is useful for beginners. Both Git Kracken and Atom integrate well with GitHub.

* Git Kracken \(recommended\)
* Atom
* Github Desktop

### Development Enviroment

LinuxGSM running on Linux and as such requires a Linux enviroment for development and testing. Most developers will be running Windows but there are multiple ways to create a Linux development enviroment.

#### Distro

LinuxGSM is primarily developed on Ubuntu but also tested to work on CentOS, Debian and Fedora. 

#### Virtual Machine

Creating a virtual machine on a desktop or laptop is a good way to create a development enviroment. Using Virtual Box and downloading the Ubuntu server iso a test enviroment can be created quickly. However to test internet functionality there may be a requirement to open ports on a home router.

If spare computer hardware is available, setting up an ESXi Server may be a good option for a development enviroment.

* Virtual Box \(reccomended\)
* VMware Player
* ESXI Server

#### Internet Server

VPS and dedicated servers can be rented relativly cheaply and is a good way to test LinuxGSM in the enviroment it is mostly used \(online\). There are several providers like Linode that provide servers from $5 p/m and allow the quick deployment of servers with different distros. Some game servers do have higher system requires than others so a more expensive VPS may be required.

* Linode
* Digital Ocean
* Oneprovider
* Kimsufi
