### How to used exit codes in code

An exit code is generated when you specify a logfile message e.g __`fn_script_log_fatal`. When you want the script to exit you must use `core_exit.sh` rather than just the exit command. `core_exit.sh` will then handle the exit and specify the last know exit code. So if the more recent command was `fn_script_log_fatal`then the exit code will be 1

#### Examples

```text
fn_script_log_fatal "RCON password is not set"
core_exit.sh
```

This will exit with code 1

```text
fn_script_log_error "RCON password is not set"
core_exit.sh
```

This will exit with code 2

```text
fn_script_log_error "SteamCMD is missing"
LinuxGSM installs SteamCMD
fn_script_log_pass "SteamCMD has been installed"
core_exit.sh
```

This will exit with code 0
